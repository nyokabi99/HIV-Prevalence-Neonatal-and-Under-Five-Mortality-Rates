## Analysis of HIV Prevalence, Neonatal, and Under-Five Mortality Rates
### Introduction
This report presents an analytical exploration of three critical public health indicators: HIV prevalence, neonatal mortality rates, and under-five mortality rates across various countries over several years. The goal is to uncover trends, correlations, and patterns that can inform public health interventions and policy decisions globally.
### Analysis and Findings
#### Neonatal Mortality Trends
- A general decline in neonatal mortality was observed globally over the years.

- Countries with historically high neonatal mortality (e.g., several Sub-Saharan African nations) showed gradual improvements, though rates remain concerning.

- Heatmaps and time series visualizations were used to showcase country-wise trends from 1990 onward.

#### Under-Five Mortality Rate
- The under-five mortality rate also demonstrated a downward trend over time, particularly in countries that have made significant investments in maternal and child healthcare.

- Strong positive correlation between neonatal and under-five mortality rates was evident. This is expected, as neonatal deaths contribute substantially to under-five mortality.



#### HIV Prevalence
- HIV prevalence rates have varied significantly across regions:

- Southern and Eastern Africa showed the highest rates in the 1990s and early 2000s.

- In many countries, prevalence began declining after the scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and prevention programs.

### Visualizations
The analysis included:

- Line graphs to show mortality trends over time.

- Heatmaps to depict mortality levels by country.

- Correlation matrices to illustrate the relationships among variables.

- Strong positive correlation between neonatal and under-five mortality rates was evident. This is expected, as neonatal deaths contribute substantially to under-five mortality.
